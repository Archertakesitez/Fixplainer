These all have to be done:

*fill requirements.txt
	- note that scikit-learn has to be version 1.2.2 for SMOTE to run on console

*label more data to enrich failure dataset (Sunny and Mike)

*implement train_your_own.py, where user can use their own labeled boxes (json file) to generate classifier and load the model for training. (Erchi and Wang Pu)
The command line should be like:
	$python3 train_your_own.py {user's json file}

*change x, y coordinates feature to relative coordinates (Wang Pu's task)
